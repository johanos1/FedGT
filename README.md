# FedGT

This code is used to obtain the results from our paper, FedGT: Identification of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation, Marvin Xhemrishi, Johan Ã–stman, Antonia Wachter-Zeh, and Alexandre Graell i Amat, accepted for publication at IEEE Transactions on Forensics and Information Security. 

## How to use it

The code in this repo allows for simulating FedGT and some other aggregation techniques on several types of attacks. The datasets supported are MNIST, CIFAR10 and ISIC2019. In order to run different datasets, please change line 71 of _main_threaded.py_ as follows:

**cfg_path = "./cfg_files/cfg_[DATASET].toml"**

where **DATASET** can be *cifar*, *isic* or *mnist*.

The hyperparameters can be set at the folder **cfg_files** and three different *.toml* file (one per dataset)

After the hyperparameters are set and line 71 has been change accordingly, run it as:

**python main_threaded.py**
